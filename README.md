## 1.	Project Title:
🏥HealthMetrics: Hospital Performance & Patient Insights Dashboard

An interactive and data-driven Power BI dashboard designed to analyze hospital operations, patient demographics, billing performance, doctor efficiency, and overall healthcare service quality.

## 2.	Description:
The Hospital Analysis Dashboard is a comprehensive Power BI report developed to monitor hospital performance metrics, patient statistics, revenue streams, and operational efficiency. It enables hospital administrators, healthcare analysts, and decision-makers to gain actionable insights into admissions, billing patterns, doctor workloads, treatment costs, and patient satisfaction levels for improved strategic planning and service optimization.

## 3.	Tech Stack:
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

• 📊 Power BI Desktop – Core data visualization and dashboard development platform

• 📂 Power Query – Data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing

• 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Calculated columns, KPIs, and dynamic measures

• 🔗 Data Modeling – Relationship building between patient, doctor, billing, and bed allocation tables

• 🗄️ SQL – Backend query extraction and structured data retrieval

## 4.	Data Source:
### Source: Hospital Management System (Structured SQL Database)

• Patient Information (ID, age, gender, blood group, admission & discharge dates, status)

• Doctor Information (specialization, experience, joining date)

• Billing Details (room charges, surgery charges, medicine charges, total cost)

• Bed Allocation Data

• Satisfaction Ratings

• Treatment & Department Data

## 5.	Features / Highlights: 
### 🔎 Business Problem

Hospitals generate massive amounts of operational and financial data daily. However, without a centralized analytical system:

• Administrators struggle to monitor revenue performance.

• It is difficult to track patient flow and bed utilization.

• Doctor workload and specialization efficiency are not clearly visible.

• Billing transparency and cost distribution analysis are limited.

• Patient satisfaction trends are hard to measure.

### 🎯 Goal of the Dashboard

To design an interactive healthcare analytics dashboard that:

• Tracks patient admissions and discharge trends.

• Monitors hospital revenue and billing breakdown.

• Analyzes doctor performance and specialization efficiency.

• Evaluates bed occupancy and hospital capacity.

• Measures patient satisfaction ratings.

• Supports data-driven operational and financial decisions.
